### Cheatsheets and Auto Generation Tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables.

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [markdown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
Copy your readme to http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

# Information Architecture

## Entity Relationship Diagram

![test-a-wheel-graph](https://github.com/PPindel/test-a-wheel/assets/114284732/ff88022d-d17f-4c27-813a-e2a81fb716e4)


## Database Choice

- Postgres as the database because the data is relational
- Heroku servers

## Data Models

Admins can create, read, edit, and delete services in the store.
Admins can create, read, edit, and delete posts in the blog section.
Registered users can interact with the blog posts by adding likes.
Registered users (customers) can create, read, edit, and delete their own Reviews of every purchase made (Order number is a unique value for each review).
Every registered user has access to a personal profile, which can be read and edited.
Every purchase made is saved and can be accessed via the profile page if the user is registered.

## Products
Products (services) are what is the main focus of the e-commerce website. Admins can add, edit, and delete the service, select the customized options, add related image, and descriptions.

### CRUD
- **Create:** If the user is an authenticated superuser, they can add a new product by clicking the profile icon in the top right corner and selecting Add product
- **Read:** All users can view the current products in the services section
- **Update:** Only admins can edit the existing product
- **Delete:** Only admins can delete the existing product

## Reviews
Registered users can review every order made. The option "Review me!" is added to the order history accessible via the profile page.

### CRUD
- **Create:** After the order is paid, the registered user can add a review
- **Read:** All users can view the current reviews in the customer ratings section
- **Update:** Only the author of the review can edit the review via frontend
- **Delete:** Only the author of the review can delete the review via frontend

## Post
Admins (superusers) can add posts in the blog sections. The reason for this is to convince potential buyers that we are reliable in what we do and that we know our stuff (all posts are related to the services we provide).

### CRUD
- **Create:** Admins can add new posts to the blog page
- **Read:** All users can read the current posts listed in the blog section
- **Update:** Admins can edit the existing posts on the blog page
- **Delete:** Admins can delete existing posts on the blog page

# Agile Process

## GitHub User Stories
All user stories are marked to show their importance.
I used MoScOw prioritization to reduce down to an MVP.
All user stories were mentioned before - [User stories](#User-Stories)

To keep the main reposotory for this project clean, please fork the repostiory into your own account. GitHub has [forking directions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) but here's what you might do:
1. login to your own gitHub account
2. navigate to [my repository](URL OF YOUR LIVE REPOSITORY)
3. In the top right corner of the page, click fork

## Development Deployment 
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in GitPod, or your preferred IDE. Start from installing the chrome extension then clicking the green gitpod button in THEIR FORKED repository, the enumerate the steps to walk them through the process as if they were brand new to this proccess. **Include screenshots** where applicable.

**Key points to cover** 
- Install required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Create env.py
- What to put in the env.py, donâ€™t disclose real values
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEV=True
- Apply Database Migrations so the database starts up `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a super user so you can add and inspect things via django admin  `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Preload data: Sometimes you might want to include steps to create data in the admin or preload a data dump [coderwall blog](https://coderwall.com/p/mvsoyg/django-dumpdata-and-loaddata) has examples on how to dump data and load it which saves a bunch of time when deploying the application from a local database to a hosted database but you donâ€™t  have to do this step
- Start the server `python3 manage.py runserver`


## Production Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a server where anyone can access the url without your machine running. This is typically Heroku. **Include screenshots** if you think they would make the process easier. Start with getting an heroku account and then setting up databases and other packages.

If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values. Do not share your personal
keys but either cut them out of the screenshot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such
values.

**Key points to cover** 
- cerating new app
- setting app name
- setting region
- entering dreaded billing info
- subscribing to a plan
- setting up db
- adding environmental values- have a list or table so user has less chance of typos
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME
>  - SECRET_KEY
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL
>  - COLLECT_STATIC
- adding build packages
- deploy
- gitHub connection
- auto vs manul deploy
- monotior logs
