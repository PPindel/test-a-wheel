## Helpful tools

### Screenshots and Videos
**Hereâ€™s a great video on how to add videos to your readme! no need to convert to gifs!!**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Cytlicv8Y

> 1. record a video via slack
> 2. download it
> 3. in github, edit your readme via the pencil icon
> 4. type a place holder word and highlight it
> 5. drag and drop mp4 file over that text
> 6. scroll down to the commit area
> 7. update the default commit message
> 8. click the green button
> 9. ```git pull``` changes to your gitpod workspace

**You can do the steps 3-9 for the image/screenshot uploads too!**

### Cheatsheets and Auto Generation Tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables.

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [markdown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
Copy your readme to http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

## User Stories
ðŸš¨**Required**

User stories evolve over a project's lifetime. Start with a wish list, do a feasibility analysis then move the ones you
will work on into gitHub, so you can track their progress.

## Initial Stories
ðŸš¨**Required**

To start the agile process this section kicks off with a bullet list/brainstorming dump about features you'd like to
have. EVERYTHING write them out in bullet form:

- As a 'user type' I 'to perform an action' so that I can 'achieve a goal'

**Examples**

- [radiology booking](https://github.com/DeannaCarina/ELHTRadiology#user-stories)
- [places/events searching site](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/what2do2day#user-stories)

## Feasibility vs Importance
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

To scope the project for a MVP (minimally viable product) a feasibility analysis was done.

The features in the table below have been taken from the user stories above. Generic features found in most websites
will also be implemented such as nav-bar, footer, obvious website purpose etc.

| Opportunity/Feature | Feasibility/Viability (score out of 5) | PurposeLevel of Importance (score out of 5) | In Or Out |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
|                     |                                        |                                             |           |
|                     |                                        |                                             |           |
|                     |                                        |                                             |           |
|                     |                                        |                                             |           |

> You should discuss the outcome of what you will be dropping based on the outcome. Making a scatter plot of the scores and coloring the dot

## Scope
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

Now you have to talk about the scope to reduce things more, you don't necessarily need all the bells and whistles, they
could be beyond your skill set. Think basic stuff.

## Design Choices
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

Now that you have let the assessors know about the target audience and users, you can go into the design choices

### Colors
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- Discuss your color pallet choices and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include a screenshot of your pallet using a tool like coolors.co

### Typography
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target
  audience.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

### Images
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

### Design Elements
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you when choosing a framework and goes hand
  in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly
  clever, add a sentence and a screenshot or reference the file the code or css is in.

> - desktop navigation
> - mobile navigation
> - footer
> - containers/cards
> - buttons
> - text input
> - textarea inputs
> - dropdowns
> - modals/layers
> - check boxes
> - switches
> - accordions/drawers
> - pagination
> - date pickers
> - maps
> - images
> - tooltips
> - icons
> - tabbed content
> - file pickers
> - video players
> - audio players

### Animations and Transitions
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've programmed
- special hover state effects

### Frameworks
ðŸš¨**Required**

- If you use bootstrap, tailwind, bulma, materialize or some other JS/CSS framework, call it out here and why you made
  that choice. (Typically I look at the design elements I want and make sure the framework supports them)

### Custom Styles
ðŸš¨**Required**

- call out any overrides you did for bootstrap styles or the framework you used, even if they are fonts and colors,
  perhaps lead assessors to the file of interest in your repo

### Custom Javascript
ðŸš¨**Required**

- call attention to any custom javascript you created to help your User Experience you can organize this by functions or
  files

# Information Architecture
As part of the requirements for this project you need to have at **least 3 custom data models**.  It's still under discussion what that means, but I'd make 1 original and then update the products to be custom to what you are selling and create another new one. It's this section that discusses your data and how each piece relates to another and draws out the CRUD functionality you built. You must have CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE for at least one model.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
ðŸš¨**Required**

Wade Williams wrote a great blog about how to add a django extension to auto create an ERD. https://wadewilliams.com/technology-software/generating-erd-for-django-applications/ You can always draw one out by hand or google sheets. You can also draw this up by hand if you want or use a spreadsheet to show your data model.

## Database Choice
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

Just state you used postgres as the database because the data is relational and heroku serves this up realitvely easily with no cost.

## Data Models
ðŸš¨**Required**

Show the accessors you know your data. If you end up using some data models from an example project, call that out and don't be as detailed about writing those up unless you added to them.

Each data model that you created yourself should have its Fields, Field Type and any validation documented.  You should also cross-reference any code in your repository that relate to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE operations for these models.

*Below is an example of a write up for an Activities Data Model*

> ### Activities Model
> Activities is a table to hold a unique icon image and name values that users have associated with events and places. It helps with sorting events and prevents the need from carrying around two data objects in the larger Events and Places data structures. The purpose of an Activities object is to provide an imagery association to a category.
> 
> | DB Key 	| Data Type 	|          Purpose          	| Form Validation                        	| DB processing    	|
> |--------	|:---------:	|:-------------------------:	|----------------------------------------	|------------------	|
> | _id    	| ObjectId  	| unique identifier         	| None                                   	| n/a              	|
> | name   	| String    	| Name of Activity          	| Required<br>Min 1 char<br>Max 50 chars 	| trim<br>to lower 	|
> | icon   	| String    	| system path to image file 	| Required                               	|                  	|
> 
> Activity entries are used by events, places and filtering.
> 
> - [x] Create - An activity is potentially created when a user successfully creates a place, creates an event, updates an event, or updates a place.
> - [x] Read - The Activities table is read when a user is adding an event, updating an event, adding a place or updating a place, to determine if a new value should be created or not. The activities table is queried for using the name and icon pair, if it is found, the ObjectId is passed to the event and places. If no match is found, a new Activity is created and that ObjectID is passed to the the place or event.
> - [ ] Update
> - [ ] Delete
> 
>  This table has no deletion or updates associated with it. It's strictly create and read. Eventually, maintenance scripts should be written to delete unused/deprecated entries.

> The reading/writing of the activities table is housed in the [what2do2day/activities/views.py](what2do2day/activities/views.py) file.

### CRUD Diagrams
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

This is if you want to go for distinction.  You can also have CRUD diagrams to show them visually how the model is used in your site.

I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and hooked it up to my google drive to create the screenshot below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/154406188-c9beb57a-2fd1-4f26-a8ed-bee320e46e3d.png)


# Agile Process

## GitHub User Stories
ðŸš¨**Required**

Now you are ready to start using Git Hub Issues to write your user stories. To get to merit levels you need to show you
have refined stories from Epics to Generic User stories.

### User Story Templates
ðŸš¨**Required**

[Here's the lesson](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70)
on how to create a User Story Templates.

If you want a chance at **DISTINCTION**, I'd suggest the following:

- Create an Epic Story template, this would have a title, the story and children stories
- Create a User Story template, this would initially have the title, the story, and a link to the Epic. Then you'd come
  back when you are prioritizing it to include the acceptance criteria, and story points, then again when you are
  working on it and fill in the tasks and adjust the story points if needed.
- Name your stories in a way that it's easy to tie the children to the EPICS by name.

Example:
EPIC: Navigation As a user, I want to have easy to see navigation on the page, so I can intuitively interact with the
site without getting frustrated.

USER STORY: Navigation: Create Template As a developer, I don't want to have copy and paste my navigation on every page.
I want to use a template to house this information, so my code is easier to maintain.

USER STORY: Navigation: Desktop As a user I want clear navigation that is up to industry standards for my desktop
experience, so I can easily find what I need on a website.

USER STORY: Navigation: Mobile As a user I want clear navigation that is up to industry standards for my mobile
experience, so I can easily find what I need on a website without the

[Here is a quick link](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/go-hrvatska/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) to some templates I set up for these
[Here is the UX for those templates where you choose a new type of issue](https://github.com/maliahavlicek/go-hrvatska/issues/new/choose)

Note: You can play around with the labels to add an EPIC one and a USER_STORY one or even ones for each MAJOR epic you have or page

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/165651335-46ab8ff3-4014-4e55-a29d-35e1d998fb42.png)


**What to keep in this section**

- include links and/or screenshots of your story template(s)

### Product Backlog
ðŸš¨**Required**

https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/085f3a8e344a4cf28b5b5355399abcc1/?child=last
This is the MILESTONE where you grab stories from the issues or USER stories you created and prioritize them and order
them, leave the epics out.

**What to keep in this section**
Include a link to your Product Catalog Milestone,

an initial screenshot, mid-point and final will help document the agile process.

## Iterations
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/71fe6c52cccf477688e924c9889f5fec/?child=first

Add links to iteration milestones (most people have ONE iteration since they are the solo worker, just state that here),
it could be that you won't have all your product backlog worked in the end, and that is ok, hte MVP might morph, you
might find other stories you want instead, it's OK.

## Progress Boards
ðŸš€ **merit & beyhond**

https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+AG101+2021_T1/courseware/a4e548ca70a3473aa890ba2ab9bf612c/7ad7f487cc6148ecb182d77feaeda269/?child=first
Add links to Progress boards

# Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so and how they tie into  your user stories.

## Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, and each page/layer of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, **include a screenshot of the implemented feature** and **at least 2 bullet points of their importance**.

# Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

## Prerequisits
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

If the user is required to have certain keys and credentials you should include this section with directions on how to get the necessary information. ex)

1. **Gmail Account:** In order to have verification and forgot password emails sent to registered users you need a
   google account. 
  - [create a gmail accoount](https://accounts.google.com/signup) 
  - [downgrade to less secure](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1) after you are signed into the gmail account, downgrade to less secure
2. **Couldinary URL**

  - go to the dashboard and copy your API environmental variable
   
    <img width="1230" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/213839829-b4f349b3-419d-4ea2-bbca-90cf3c663bba.png">     
 
## Fork and Clone the Repository
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**
To keep the main reposotory for this project clean, please fork the repostiory into your own account. GitHub has [forking directions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) but here's what you might do:
1. login to your own gitHub account
2. navigate to [my repository](URL OF YOUR LIVE REPOSITORY)
3. In the top right corner of the page, click fork 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/213840378-e785eaa0-712b-468c-bcda-64fde56eae44.png)

4. set yourself as the owner
5. change the name of the repo if you want
6. add a description if you want
7. choose what to copy, typicall the main branch only
8. click the snazy green button

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/213840549-5bef12ae-198e-412b-84b6-0cc718b6fa1d.png)

9. To get files to your local environment, you need to clone it: click the code button
10. Copy the url as needed (here's gitHub instructions)[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository}



## Development Deployment 
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in GitPod, or your preferred IDE. Start from installing the chrome extension then clicking the green gitpod button in THEIR FORKED repository, the enumerate the steps to walk them through the process as if they were brand new to this proccess. **Include screenshots** where applicable.

**Key points to cover** 
- Install required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Create env.py
- What to put in the env.py, donâ€™t disclose real values
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEV=True
- Apply Database Migrations so the database starts up `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a super user so you can add and inspect things via django admin  `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Preload data: Sometimes you might want to include steps to create data in the admin or preload a data dump [coderwall blog](https://coderwall.com/p/mvsoyg/django-dumpdata-and-loaddata) has examples on how to dump data and load it which saves a bunch of time when deploying the application from a local database to a hosted database but you donâ€™t  have to do this step
- Start the server `python3 manage.py runserver`


## Production Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a server where anyone can access the url without your machine running. This is typically Heroku. **Include screenshots** if you think they would make the process easier. Start with getting an heroku account and then setting up databases and other packages.

If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values. Do not share your personal
keys but either cut them out of the screenshot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such
values.

**Key points to cover** 
- cerating new app
- setting app name
- setting region
- entering dreaded billing info
- subscribing to a plan
- setting up db
- adding environmental values- have a list or table so user has less chance of typos
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME
>  - SECRET_KEY
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL
>  - COLLECT_STATIC
- adding build packages
- deploy
- gitHub connection
- auto vs manul deploy
- monotior logs
